# Final Project Proposal

For my final project I would like to recreate Pong within P5. Ideally, it would feature sound effects, a computer opponent that can play at different difficulties, and a fully functioning scoreboard.

Mockup:

Example: Classic Pong

Potential Road Blocks:
Programming the computer combatant will most likely be a long and frustrating process. I expect road blocks around every corner as I relearn aspects of P5 that I'll need to utilize in order to create my project.

Work Schedule:
By the end of the coming weekend (11/20) I plan to have an outline of the classes and variables I'll need. By the end of the following week, I want to have a working version minus the computer combatant. The following 2 weeks after that will be dedicated to programming the computer combatant and working out any bugs.
