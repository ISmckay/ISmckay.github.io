# Final Project Overview

For my final project I recreated the original videogame, Pong. I spent a lot of time getting it to where it is and I'm proud to share my work. I wish I had tackled different aspects of my project earlier so that I could've had more time to fine tune and improve upon my project. It was fun making my own game (even if I was just ripping off the OG) and I enjoyed watching my work become interactive.
